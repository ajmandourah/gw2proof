# Gw2proof

This is a simple script created to generate Legendary insights (LI) , an item that can be obtained while clearing raids in Gw2, which currently used to proof that your game knowledge is somehow decent in comparison with newbies. 

The usage of LI created a lot of toxicity in the game which used not to be so in the old days. That's not to say that proofing LI is not helpful as a knowledgeable party is great in clearing contents in the most effective way but in the end LI is not a marker for that

Using the script is so easy :

1. Download the latest release in the release section. 
2. Extract the zipped file. 
3. run the script as administrator (needed for the keyboard and copy and paste action of the code). 
4. Make sure guild wars 2 is running and you are logged in To you character. 
5. Write the amount LI needed and click generate. 
6. The script will change the window to gw2 and paste the code to the chat several times to simulate a normal user clicks. 


# Todo:
Adding other Killing proof that some parties is requesting.
