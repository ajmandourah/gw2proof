# whats gw2proof
This is a simple script created to generate Legendary insights (LI) , an item that can be obtained while clearing raids in Gw2, which currently used to proof that your game knowledge is somehow decent in comparison with newbies. 

# why you would use it?
The usage of LI created a lot of toxicity in the game which used not to be so in the old days. That's not to say that proofing LI is not helpful as a knowledgeable party is great in clearing contents in the most effective way but in the end LI is not a marker for that. 


# Usage

[Check the youtube video for demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7CnGWXaNO4)

1. Download the latest release in the [release section](https://github.com/ajmandourah/gw2proof/releases)
2. Run the excutable file.
3. The program will ask for administrator rights (needed for the keyboard and copy and paste action of the code). 
4. Make sure guild wars 2 is running and you are logged in To you character. 
5. Write the amount LI / KP needed and click generate. 
6. The script will change the window to gw2 and paste the code to the chat several times to simulate a normal user clicks. 
7. enjoy !!!

# latest changlog
- Added the fractal of the mist CM KP.
- A complete change in the GUI. Instead for Tkinter (which is ugly) now using pywebview. This is for much snappier load and low file size.

# ToDo
- Adding a funny chat codes.
- remove the windows warning.
- you tell me..;)
